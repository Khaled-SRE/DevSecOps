## System Architecture

### DefectDojo Integration

This is done via [the python script (PY)](../upload_to_defectdojo.py)

### Key Components
1. **Vulnerability Discovery**: Automated and manual security testing
2. **Data Ingestion**: DefectDojo API integration with scanning tools - Dast -
3. **Risk Assessment**: CVSS scoring and business impact analysis
4. **Tracking & Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards and reporting
5. **Remediation Management**: Assignment, tracking, and verification

## Vulnerability Lifecycle Management

### 1. Discovery Phase
- **Automated Scanning**: Integration with OWASP ZAP, Nessus, Burp Suite
- **Manual Testing**: Penetration testing and code review findings
- **Third-party Reports**: Bug bounty and external audit results

### 2. Triage & Assessment
- **CVSS Scoring**: Automated severity classification
- **Business Impact**: Custom risk scoring based on asset criticality
- **False Positive Detection**: ML-assisted duplicate and false positive identification

### 3. Assignment & Tracking
- **Automated Assignment**: Rule-based allocation to development teams
- **SLA Management**: Deadline tracking based on severity levels
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time status updates and notifications

### 4. Verification & Closure
- **Remediation Verification**: Automated and manual testing
- **Risk Acceptance**: Formal approval process for accepted risks
- **Documentation**: Complete audit trail and evidence collection
